<h> Testing Seasonality with Dickey-Fuller Test

Overview:
This repository contains code for testing seasonality in time series data using the Dickey-Fuller test. The Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical test used to determine whether a unit root is present in a time series dataset, indicating non-stationarity. In this context, it helps identify if seasonality is a significant component of the data.
